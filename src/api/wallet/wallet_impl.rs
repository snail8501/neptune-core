/// provides an API for interacting with the neptune-core wallet.
///
/// This type is built from a [StateLock] which means it can
/// use a [GlobalStateLock] or an already-acquired lock guard.
///
/// ### case: lock guard provided
///
/// If provided with a lock-guard then each method will simply use the guard.
/// Be careful though: if a mutable method is called on a read-guard a panic
/// will result.
///
/// If multiple Wallet method calls are made, the series of calls will see (or mutate)
/// a consistent, atomic view of global-state.
///
/// When `Wallet` is dropped, the guard will also be dropped and the lock
/// released.
///
/// If one wishes to continue using the guard then `StateLock::from(wallet)`
/// or `Wallet::into_inner()` may be used to regain ownership.
///
/// ### case: global-state-lock provided
///
/// If not provided with a lock guard then each method call will acquire the
/// lock in read-or write mode as necessary.
///
/// If multiple wallet methods are invoked they will be independent and any
/// changes will not be atomic across the series.
